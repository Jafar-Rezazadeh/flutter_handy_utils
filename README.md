### Widgets

- GroupedRadioButton: A widget that displays a group of radio buttons.

## Usage

> ### TreeBuilder:

creating structured parent-child relationship using the `TreeBuilder` util.

1. make a list of `TreeInputItem`:

   ```dart
   final list = [
      TreeInputItem<T>(id: int, parentId: int, data: <T>)
      TreeInputItem<T>(id: int, parentId: int, data: <T>)
      TreeInputItem<T>(id: int, parentId: int, data: <T>)
   ];
   ```

2. create an instance of TreeBuilder with the given type:

   ```dart
   final treeBuilder = TreeBuilder<T>();
   ```

3. make the structured parent-child relationship using:

   ```dart
   final result = treeBuilder.buildTree(list);
   ```

the result will be a `List<TreeOutPutItem<T>>` which contain the parent item and its children.

> ### WidgetsSeparator:

separates the list of widgets by adding a gap or divider in between them.

`withDividerInBetween`:

```dart
   listOfWidgets.withDividerInBetween(
        color: Colors.red,
        height: 20,
        thickness: 20,
        indent: 20,
        endIndent: 20,
      );

```

`withGapInBetween`:

```dart
   listOfWidgets.withGapInBetween(gapSize: 20);
```

> ### StringEllipsSize:

Returns a new string truncated from the start or end to the specified maximum length.

```dart
String text = "This is a very long string";

String truncatedText = text.ellipsSize(maxLength: 10);
print(truncatedText); // "This is a..."

String truncatedTextFromStart = text.ellipsSize(maxLength: 10, fromStart: true);
print(truncatedTextFromStart); // "...very long string".

```

> ### GroupedRadioButton:

displays a group of radio buttons, where only one radio button can be selected at a time. The radio buttons are displayed in a column layout.

```dart
GroupedRadioButton<String>(
  items: [
    GroupedRadioButtonItem(title: Text("Option 1"), value: "option1"),
    GroupedRadioButtonItem(title: Text("Option 2"), value: "option2"),
  ],
  onChanged: (value) {
    print(value);
  },
  initialGroupValue: "option1",
),

```
